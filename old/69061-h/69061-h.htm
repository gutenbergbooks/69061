<span class="h_subtitle">PRECISION LOCATING METHODS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The degree of accuracy that is necessary in the construction of
certain classes of machinery and tools, has made it necessary for
toolmakers and machinists to employ various methods and appliances
for locating holes or finished surfaces to given dimensions and
within the prescribed limits of accuracy. In this treatise, various
approved methods of locating work, such as are used more particularly
in tool-rooms, are described and illustrated. These are not given, in
every case, as being the best possible method under all conditions,
because, as every mechanical man knows, the best way may be dependent
upon the element of accuracy with little regard for the time required
to do the work, or this order may be reversed; therefore, one method is
seldom, if ever, the best under all circumstances, and it is necessary
for the workman to consider the conditions in each case and then be
guided by his judgment and experience in determining just how the work
should be done.</p>

<h3 id="BUTTON">Button Method of Accurately<br /> Locating Work</h3>

<p>Among the different methods employed by toolmakers for accurately
locating work such as jigs, etc., on the faceplate of a lathe, one of
the most commonly used is known as the “button method.” This method is
so named because cylindrical bushings or buttons are attached to the
work in positions corresponding to the holes to be bored, after which
they are used in locating the work. These buttons which are ordinarily
about ½ or ⅝ inch in diameter, are ground and lapped to the same size,
and the ends are finished perfectly square. The outside diameter
should preferably be such that the radius can easily be determined,
and the hole through the center should be about ⅛ inch larger than the
retaining screw so that the button can be adjusted laterally.</p>

<p>As a simple example of the practical application of the button method,
suppose three holes are to be bored in a jig-plate according to the
dimensions given in <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>. A common method of procedure would
be as follows: First lay out the centers of all holes to be bored, by the
usual method. Mark these centers with a prick-punch and then drill
holes for the machine screws which are used to clamp the buttons. After
the buttons are clamped lightly in place, set them in correct relation
with each other and with the jig-plate. The proper location of the
buttons is very important, as their positions largely determine the
accuracy of the work. The best method of locating a number of buttons
depends, to some extent, upon their relative positions, the instruments
available, and the accuracy required. When buttons must be located at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
given distances from the finished sides of a jig, a surface plate and
vernier height gage are often used. The method is to place that side
from which the button is to be set, upon an accurate surface plate and
then set the button by means of the height gage, allowance being made,
of course, for the radius of the button. The center-to-center distance
between the different buttons can afterwards be verified by taking
direct measurements with a micrometer.</p>

<div class="figcenter space-above3">
  <img id="FIG_1" src="images/i_04.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="285" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 1</b>. Simple Example of Work
                   Illustrating Application of Button Method</p>
</div>

<p>Figs. <a href="#FIG_2">2</a> and <a href="#FIG_3">3</a>
illustrate a method which requires only a micrometer.
Two of the buttons are set at the correct distance from one edge of the
plate by measuring from a parallel strip. Obviously, the micrometer
reading will exceed the distance from the center of a button to the
edge of the plate, by the amount equal to the thickness of the parallel
strip plus the radius of the button. The center-to-center distance
between each pair of buttons is also tested as indicated in <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>,
by measuring the overall distance and deducting the diameter of one button.</p>

<p>After the buttons have been set and the screws are tightened, all
measurements should be carefully checked. The work is then mounted
on the faceplate of the lathe and one of the buttons is set true by
the use of a test indicator as shown in <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>.
When the dial of the indicator ceases to vibrate, thus showing that the
button runs true, the latter should be removed so that the hole can
be drilled and bored to the required size. In a similar manner other
buttons are indicated and the holes bored, one at a time. It is evident
that if each button is correctly located and set perfectly true in the
lathe, the various holes will be located the required distance apart
within very close limits.</p>

  <img id="FIG_2" src="images/i_05.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="405" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 2</b>. Determining Distance
                         from Button to Edge of Plate</p>
</div>

<p>Another example of work illustrating the application of the button
method is shown in <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a>. The disk-shaped part illustrated is
a flange templet which formed a part of a fixture for drilling holes in flanged
plates, the holes being located on a circle 6 inches in diameter.
It was necessary to space the six holes equi-distantly so that the
holes in the flanges would match in any position, thus making them
interchangeable. First a plug was turned so that it fitted snugly in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
1¼-inch central hole of the plate and projected above the top surface
about ¾ inch. A center was located in this plug and from it a circle
of three inches radius was drawn. This circle was divided into six
equal parts and then small circles ⅝ inch in diameter were drawn to
indicate the outside circumference of the bushings to be placed in
the holes. These circles served as a guide when setting the button
and enabled the work to be done much more quickly. The centers of the
holes were next carefully prick-punched and small holes were drilled
and tapped for No. 10 machine screws. After this the six buttons
were attached in approximately the correct positions and the screws
tightened enough to hold the buttons firmly, but allow them to be
moved by tapping lightly. As the radius of the circle is 3 inches,
the radius of the central plug, ⅝ inch, and that of each button, ⁵/₁₆
inch, the distance from the outside of the central plug to the outside
of any button, when correctly set, must be 3 ¹⁵/₁₆ inches. Since there
are six buttons around the circle, the center-to-center distance is
equal to the radius, and the distance between the outside or any two
buttons should be 3⅝ inches. Having determined these dimensions, each
button is set equi-distant from the central plug and the required
distance apart, by using a micrometer. As each button is brought into
its correct position, it should be tightened down a little so that it
will be located firmly when finally set. The work is then strapped to
the faceplate of a lathe and each button is indicated for boring the
different holes by means of an indicator, as previously described. When
the buttons are removed it will be found that in nearly all cases the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
small screw holes will not run exactly true; therefore, it is advisable
to form a true starting point for the drill by using a lathe tool.</p>

<div class="figcenter space-above3">
  <img id="FIG_3" src="images/i_06.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="511" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 3</b>. Testing Location of Buttons</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a> shows a method of locating buttons
from the finished sides of a plate, and this same plate with the five
buttons attached is shown in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>. As the
dimensions in <a href="#FIG_7">Fig. 7</a> indicate, the holes must not
only be accurate with relation to each other, but also with reference
to the edges of the templet; therefore, it is necessary to work from
the sides as well as the center. The width of the plate was first
measured carefully and found to be 5 inches. As the center-to-center
distance between buttons <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> and also buttons
<i>D</i> and <i>E</i>, is 2½ inches, the distance from the center of
each outside button to the edge of the plate is 1¼ inch. A ¼-inch
parallel was clamped against the side, as shown in the illustration,
and then the distance from the outside of each button to the outside
of the parallel (1 ¹³/₁₆ inch) was measured in conjunction with the
distance <i>L</i> from the central button. The distance <i>L</i> was
obtained by first determining the center-to-center distance <i>M</i>
which represents the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.</p>

<p class="f120"><i>M</i>² = 1.25² + 1.625²</p>

<p class="f120 no-wrap">or <i>M</i> = √<span class="over">1.25² + 1.625²</span>
                            = √<span class="over">4.024</span> = 2.050 inches.</p>

<p class="f120">Therefore, <i>L</i> = 2.050 + 0.625 = 2.675 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
In this case, the center button was first located correctly from the
sides and end and then the other buttons were set. When doing precision
work of this kind, the degree of accuracy obtained will depend upon
the instruments used, the judgment and skill of the workman, and the
care exercised. A good general rule to follow when locating bushings
or buttons is to use the method which is the most direct and which
requires the least number of measurements, in order to prevent an
accumulation of errors.</p>

<h3>Locating Work by the Disk Method</h3>

<p>Comparatively small precision work is sometimes located by the disk
method, which is the same in principle as the button method, the chief
difference being that disks are used instead of buttons. These disks
are made to such diameters that when their peripheries are in contact,
each disk center will coincide with the position of the hole to be
bored; the centers are then used for locating the work. To illustrate
this method, suppose that the master-plate shown at the left in <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a>
is to have three holes <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> bored into it,
to the center distances given.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_4" src="images/i_07.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 4</b>. Testing Concentricity
                       of Button Preparatory to Boring Hole in Lathe</p>
</div>

<p>It is first necessary to determine the diameters of the disks. If
the center distances between all the holes were equal, the diameters
would, of course, equal this dimension. When, however, the distances
between the centers are unequal, the diameters may be found as follows:
Subtract, say, dimension <i>y</i> from <i>x</i>, thus obtaining the
difference between the radii of disks <i>C</i> and <i>A</i> (<a href="#FIG_8">see
right-hand sketch</a>); add this difference to dimension <i>z</i>, and the
result will be the diameter of disk <i>A</i>. Dividing this diameter
by 2 gives the radius, which, subtracted from center distance <i>x</i>
equals the radius of <i>B</i>; similarly the radius of <i>B</i>
subtracted from dimension <i>y</i> equals the radius of <i>C</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">For example, 0.930-0.720 = 0.210 or the difference
between the radii of disks <i>C</i> and <i>A</i>. Then the diameter of
<i>A</i> = 0.210 + 0.860 = 1.070 inch, and the radius equals 1.070 ÷
2 = 0.535 inch. The radius of <i>B</i> = 0.930-0.535 = 0.395 inch and
0.395 × 2 = 0.790, or the diameter of <i>B</i>. The center distance
0.720-0.395 = 0.325, which is the radius of <i>C</i>; 0.325 × 2 = 0.650
or the diameter of <i>C</i>.</p>

  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 6</b>. Hinge Jig Templet with Buttons Attached</p>
</div>

<p>After determining the diameters, the disks should be turned nearly to
size and finished, preferably in a bench lathe. First insert a solder
chuck in the spindle, face it perfectly true, and attach the disk by a
few drops of solder, being careful to hold the work firmly against the
chuck while soldering. Face the outer side and cut a sharp V-center
in it; then grind the periphery to the required diameter. Next fasten
the finished disks onto the work in their correct locations with their
peripheries in contact, and then set one of the disks exactly central
with the lathe spindle by applying a test indicator to the center in
the disk. After removing the disk and boring the hole, the work is
located for boring the other holes in the same manner.

                  in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a></p>
</div>

<p>Small disks may be secured to the work by means of jeweler’s wax.
This is composed of common rosin and plaster of paris and is made as
follows: Heat the rosin in a vessel until it flows freely, and then add
plaster of paris and keep stirring the mixture. Care should be taken
not to make the mixture too stiff. When it appears to have the proper
consistency, pour some of it onto a slate or marble slab and allow it
to cool; then insert the point of a knife under the flattened cake thus
formed and try to pry it off. If it springs off with a slight metallic
ring, the proportions are right, but if it is gummy and ductile,
there is too much rosin. On the other hand, if it is too brittle and
crumbles, this indicates that there is too much plaster of paris. The
wax should be warmed before using. A mixture of beeswax and shellac, or
beeswax and rosin in about equal proportions, is also used for holding
disks in place. When the latter are fairly large, it may be advisable
to secure them with small screws, provided the screw holes are not
objectionable.</p>

<h3>Disk-and-Button Method of<br /> Locating Holes</h3>

<p>The accuracy of work done by the button method previously described
is limited only by the skill and painstaking care of the workman,
but setting the buttons requires a great deal of time. By a little
modification, using what is sometimes called the “disk-and-button
method,” a large part of this time can be saved without any sacrifice
of accuracy. The disk-and-button method is extensively used in many
shops. Buttons are used, but they are located in the centers of disks
of whatever diameters are necessary to give the required locations.
As three disks are used in each step of the process, it is sometimes
called the “three-disk method.”</p>

<p>To illustrate the practical application of this method, suppose six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
equally-spaced holes are to be located in the circumference of a
circle six inches in diameter. To locate these, one needs, besides the
buttons, three disks three inches in diameter, each having a central
hole exactly fitting the buttons. It is best to have, also, a bushing
of the same diameter as the buttons, which has a center-punch fitted
to slide in it. First the center button is screwed to the templet, and
one of the disks <i>A</i>, <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a>, is slipped over
it; then a second disk <i>B</i> carrying a bushing and center-punch
is placed in contact with disk <i>A</i> and a light blow on the punch
marks the place to drill and tap for No. 2 button, which is kept in
its proper place while tightening the screw by holding the two disks
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in contact. Next the third disk <i>C</i> is
placed in contact with disks <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> and locates No. 3
button, and so on until the seven buttons are secured in position.
The templet is then ready to be strapped to the lathe faceplate for boring.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_8" src="images/i_10.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="294" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 8</b>. An Example of Precision Work,
                  and Method<br /> of Locating Holes by Use of Disks in Contact</p>
</div>

<p>Of course, it is not possible to use disks of “standard” sizes for
many operations, but making a special disk is easy, and its cost
is insignificant as compared with the time saved by its use. One
who employs this method, especially if he also uses disks to lay
out angles, soon accumulates a stock of various sizes. While it is
desirable to have disks of tool steel, hardened and ground, or, in the
larger sizes, of machine steel, case-hardened and ground, a disk for
occasional use will be entirely satisfactory if left soft.</p>

<p>Another example of work is shown in <a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a>.
This is a jig templet similar to the one illustrated in Figs.
<a href="#FIG_6">6</a> and <a href="#FIG_7">7</a>. Sketch <i>A</i> gives
its dimensions and sketch <i>B</i> shows the disk-and-button way of
locating the holes. A steel square is clamped with its stock against
the right-hand edge of the templet and its blade extending across the
top. The lower edge of the blade should be located 0.250 inch from the
upper edge of the templet by the use of size blocks. A 2½-inch disk,
touching both blade and stock, locates hole <i>C</i>. Another 2½-inch

             and Equi-distant<br /> by using Disks and Buttons in Combination</p>
</div>

<p>Two other jobs that illustrate this method may be of interest.
The first one, shown in <a href="#FIG_11">Fig. 11</a>, required the locating
of nine equally-spaced holes on a circumference of 7⅜ inches diameter. In any
such case, the size of the smaller disks is found by multiplying the
diameter of the circle upon which the centers of the disks are located
by the sine of half the angle between two adjacent disks. The angle
between the centers of adjacent disks equals 360 ÷ number of disks.
360 ÷ 9 = 40; hence, in this case, the diameter of the smaller disks
equals 7⅜ multiplied by the sine of 20 degrees, or 7⅜ × 0.34202 =
2.5224 inches. 7⅜-2.5224 = 4.8526 inches, which is the diameter of
the central disk.</p>

<p>The templet shown in <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a> required two holes on a
circumference 6½ inches diameter, with their centers 37 degrees 20 minutes apart.
To find the diameter of the smaller disks, multiply the diameter of the
large circle by the sine of one-half the required angle, as in the
preceding example; thus 6½ × sin 18 degrees 40 minutes = 2.0804 inches,
which is the diameter of the two smaller disks. The diameter of the
larger disk equals 6½-2.0804 = 4.4196 inches.</p>

<p>Very accurate results can be obtained by the disk-and-button method. Of
course, absolute exactness is equally unattainable with buttons and a
micrometer, or any other method; the micrometer does not show the slight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
inaccuracy in any one chordal measurement, while in using the disks the
error is accumulative and the insertion of the last disk in the series
shows the sum of the errors in all the disks. It is only in cases like
the one illustrated in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a> that we note this,
and then, though in correcting the error, we may change the diameter of
the circle a very slight amount, an exceedingly accurate division of
the circumference is secured.</p>

<p>Use of Two- and Three-Diameter Disks</p>

<p><a href="#FIG_13">Fig. 13</a> illustrates, on an enlarged scale, a piece
of work requiring great accuracy, which was successfully handled by
an extension of the three-disk method. Fourteen holes were required
in a space hardly larger than a silver half-dollar, and, although the
drawing gave dimensions from the center of the circle, the actual
center could not be used in doing the work, as there was to be no hole
there; moreover, a boss slightly off center prevented the use of a
central disk, unless the bottom of the disk were bored out to receive
this boss, which was not thought expedient. Hence, the method adopted
was to make the plate thicker than the dimension given on the drawing,
and then bore it out to leave a rim of definite diameter, this rim to
be removed after it had served its purpose as a locating limit for the
disks.</p>

                  (B) Disk-and-Button Method of Locating Holes</p>
</div>

<p>As the holes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, which were finished first, were
0.600 inch apart and 0.625 inch from the center, the rim was bored
to 1.850 inch and two 0.600-inch disks, in contact with the rim and
with each other, located these holes. As hole <i>C</i> was to be
equi-distant from holes <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and its distance from
the center was given, the size of the disk for this hole was readily
determined. The disks for holes <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
two diameters; the upper diameters are made to whatever size is
required for locating the disks of adjacent holes, and they also form
a hub which can be used when setting the disks with an indicator. Hole
<i>D</i> was 0.4219 inch from <i>B</i>, and calculations based on this
dimension and its distance from the center showed that it was 0.4375
inch from hole <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>A “three-story” disk or button was made for hole <i>D</i>. The diameter
of the large part was 0.46875 inch and it overlapped disks <i>C</i>
and <i>B</i> (the upper sections of which were made 0.375 inch and
0.4062 inch, respectively), thus locating <i>D</i>. Then hole <i>F</i>
and all the remaining holes were located in a similar manner. The
upper diameters of disks <i>E</i> and <i>D</i> were used in locating
disks for other adjacent holes, as well as a hub for the indicator;
for instance, to locate a hole with reference to holes <i>C</i> and
<i>D</i>, the diameter of the new disk and the diameter of the upper
part of disk <i>D</i>, were varied to give the required location. The
relation between the disks <i>B</i>, <i>D</i> and <i>F</i> is shown by
the side view.</p>

</div>

<p>It had been decided that no screws should be used in attaching the
buttons or disks to the work, as it was feared that the tapped holes
would introduce inaccuracy by deflecting the boring-tools; therefore
the following method was employed. After all the disks were fastened
in place by clamps, a soft solder of low melting point was flowed
about them, filling the work to the top of the rim. When the solder
had cooled, the clamps were removed, the work transferred to the
lathe faceplate, indicated in the usual way, and the holes bored by a
“<i>D</i>” or “hog-nose” drill, guided by an axial hole in each disk,
which had been provided for that purpose when the disks were made. It
was thought that the unequal contraction of the solder and the plate
in cooling might throw the holes “out of square;” however, careful
measurements failed to show any appreciable lack of parallelism in
test-bars inserted in the holes.

<h3>Accurate Angular Measurements with Disks</h3>

<p>For setting up a piece of work on which a surface is to be planed
or milled at an exact angle to a surface already finished, disks provide
an accurate means of adjustment. One method of using disks for
angular work is illustrated at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>.
Let us assume that the lower edge of plate shown is finished and that
the upper edge is to be milled at an angle <i>a</i> of 32 degrees with
the lower edge. If the two disks <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are to be used
for locating the work, how far apart must they be set in order to
locate it at the required angle? The center-to-center distance can be
determined as follows: Subtract the radius of the larger disk from the
radius of the smaller disk, and divide the difference by the sine of
one-half the required angle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_14" src="images/i_15.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="276" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 14</b>. Obtaining Accurate
           Angular Measurements with Disks</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Example</i>: If the required angle <i>a</i> is 32 degrees, the
radius of the large disk, 2 inches, and the radius of the small disk, 1
inch, what is the center-to-center distance?</p>

<p>The sine of one-half the required angle, or 16 degrees, is 0.27564.
The difference between the radii of the disks equals 2 - 1 = 1, and 1
÷ 0.27564 = 3.624 inches. Therefore, for an angle of 32 degrees, disks
of the sizes given should be set so that the distance between their
centers is 3.624 inches.</p>
</div>

<p>Another method of accurately locating angular work is illustrated at
<i>B</i> in <a href="#FIG_14">Fig. 14</a>. In this case, two disks are
also used, but they are placed in contact with each other and changes
for different angles are obtained by varying the diameter of the larger
disk. The smaller disk is a standard 1-inch size, such as is used for
setting a 2-inch micrometer. By this method any angle up to about 40
degrees can be obtained within a very close limit of accuracy. The
following rule may be used for determining the diameter of the larger
disk, when both disks are in contact and the diameter of the small disk
is known:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Multiply twice the diameter of the small disk by the sine of one-half
the required angle; divide this product by 1 minus the sine of one-half
the required angle; add the quotient to the diameter of the small disk
to obtain the diameter of the large disk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Example</i>: The required angle a is 15 degrees.
Find the diameter of the large disk to be in contact
with the standard 1-inch reference disk.</p>

<p>The sine of 7 degrees 30 minutes is 0.13053.
Multiplying twice the diameter of the small disk by the sine of 7
degrees 30 minutes, we have 2 × 1 × 0.13053 = 0.26106. This product
divided by 1 minus the sine of 7 degrees 30 minutes</p>

<h3>Disk-and-Square Method of Determining Angles</h3>

<p>The method shown in <a href="#FIG_15">Fig. 15</a> for determining
angles for setting up work on a milling machine or planer, possesses
several advantages. No expensive tools are required, the method can be
applied quickly, and the results obtained are quite accurate enough for
any but the most exacting requirements. As will be seen, an ordinary
combination square is used in connection with a disk, the head of the
square being set at different points on the blade according to the
angle that is desired. Theoretically, a one-inch disk could be used for
all angles from about 6 degrees up to a right angle, but in practice it
is more convenient and accurate to employ larger disks for the larger angles.</p>

<p>The only inaccuracy resulting from this method is due to setting the
square at the nearest “scale fraction” instead of at the exact point
determined by calculation. This error is very small, however, and is
negligible in practically all cases. The dimension <i>x</i> required
for any desired angle <i>a</i> can be found by multiplying the radius
of the disk, by the cotangent of one-half the desired angle, and adding
to this product the radius of the disk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Example</i>: The square blade is to be set to an angle of 15
degrees 10 minutes, using a 2-inch disk. At what distance <i>x</i>
(<a href="#FIG_15">see Fig. 15</a>) should the head of the square be set?</p>

<p class="f110">Cot 7 degrees 35 minutes = 7.5113,<br /> and 7.5113 × 1
+ 1 = 8.5113 inches.</p>

<p class="no-indent">By setting the square to 8½ inches “full,” the
blade would be set very close to the required angle of 15 degrees 10
minutes.</p>
</div>

<h3>Locating Work by means of Size Blocks</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
The size-block method of locating a jig-plate or other part, in
different positions on a lathe faceplate, for boring holes accurately
at given center-to-center distances, is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a>.
The way the size blocks are used in this particular instance is as follows:
A pair of accurate parallels are attached to a faceplate at right angles
to each other and they are so located that the center of one of the
holes to be bored will coincide with the lathe spindle. The hole which
is aligned in this way should be that one on the work which is nearest
the outer corner, so that the remaining holes can be set in a central
position by adjusting the work away from the parallels. After the first
hole is bored, the work is located for boring each additional hole by
placing size blocks of the required width between the edges of the
work and the parallels. For instance, to set the plate for boring hole
<i>D</i>, size blocks (or a combination of blocks or gages) equal in
width to dimension <i>A</i>₁ would be inserted at <i>A</i>, and other
blocks equal in width to dimension <i>B</i>₁ beneath the work as at
<i>B</i>. As will be seen, the dimensions of these blocks equal the
horizontal and vertical distances between holes <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>.
With the use of other combinations of gage blocks, any additional holes
that might be required are located in the central position. While only
two holes are shown in this case, it will be understood that the plate
could be located accurately for boring almost any number of holes by
this method.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_16" src="images/i_18.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="308" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 16</b>. Method of setting Work on Faceplate<br />
              with Size Blocks or Gages</p>
</div>

<p>Incidentally, such gages as the Johansson combination gages are
particularly suited for work of this kind, as any dimension within
the minimum and maximum limits of a set can be obtained by simply
placing the required sizes together. Sometimes when such gages are not
available, disks which have been ground to the required diameter are
interposed between the parallels and the work for securing accurate
locations. Another method of securing a positive adjustment of the
work is to use parallels composed of two tapering sections, which
can be adjusted to vary the width and be locked together by means of
screws. Each half has the same taper so that outer edges are parallel
for any position, and the width is measured by using a micrometer. The
size-block method is usually applied to work having accurately machined
edges, although a part having edges which are of a rough or irregular
shape can be located by this method, if it is mounted on an auxiliary
plate having accurately finished square edges. For instance, if holes
were to be bored in the casting for a jig templet which had simply been
planed on the top and bottom, the casting could be bolted to a finished
plate having square edges and the latter be set in the different
positions required, by means of size blocks. Comparatively large jig
plates are sometimes located for boring in this way and the milling
machine is often used instead of a lathe.</p>

<h3>The Master-plate Method</h3>

<p>When it is necessary to machine two or more plates so that they are
duplicates as to the location of holes, circular recesses, etc.,
what is known as a master-plate is often used for locating the work
on the lathe faceplate. This master-plate <i>M</i> (<a href="#FIG_17">see Fig. 17</a>)
contains holes which correspond to those wanted in the work, and which
accurately fit a central plug <i>P</i> in the lathe spindle, so that
by engaging first one hole and then another with the plug, the work is
accurately positioned for the various operations.</p>

<p>When making the master-plate, great care should be taken to have the
sides parallel and the holes at right angles to the sides, as well as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
accurately located with reference to one another. The various holes
may be located with considerable precision by the use of buttons as
previously described. Of course, it is necessary to have a hole in the
master-plate for each different position in which the work will have to
be placed on the faceplate; for example, if a circular recess <i>r</i>
were required, a hole <i>r</i>₁ exactly concentric with it would be
needed in the master-plate. The method of holding the work and locating
it with reference to the holes in the master-plate will depend largely
on its shape. The cylindrical blank <i>B</i> illustrated, is positioned
by a recess in the master-plate in which it fits. The work is commonly
held to the master-plate by means of clamps and tap bolts or by screws
which pass through the work and into the master-plate. Solder is sometimes
used when it is not convenient to hold the work by clamps or screws.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_17" src="images/i_19.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="321" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 17</b>. Master-plate applied
                       to a Bench Lathe Faceplate</p>
</div>

<p>The plug <i>P</i> which locates the master-plate, is first turned to
fit the spindle or collet of the lathe and the outer or projecting end
is roughturned for the holes in the master-plate, which should all be
finished to exactly the same diameter. The plug is then inserted in
the spindle and ground and lapped to a close fit for the holes in
the master-plate. The latter, with the work attached to it, is next
clamped to the faceplate by the straps shown, which engage a groove
around the edge of the master-plate. The first hole is finished by
drilling to within, say, 0.005 or 0.006 inch of the size, and then
boring practically to size, a very small amount being left for reaming
or grinding. The remaining holes can then be finished in the same
way, the work being positively located in each case by loosening the
master-plate and engaging the proper hole in it with the central plug.
It is apparent that by the use of this same master-plate, a number of
pieces <i>B</i> could be made which would be practically duplicates.</p>

<p>The master-plate method of locating work can be applied in many
different ways. It is used for making duplicate dies, for accurately
locating the various holes in watch movements, and for many other
operations requiring great precision. Master-plates are quite frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
used by toolmakers when it is necessary to produce a number of drill
jigs which are to be used for drilling holes in different parts having
the same relative locations, thus requiring jigs that are duplicates
within very close limits.</p>

<p>When a master-plate is required, that is to be used in making
duplicates of an existing model, the holes are bored in the
master-plate by reversing the process <a href="#FIG_17">illustrated in Fig. 17</a>.
That is, the central plug <i>P</i> is turned to fit the largest hole in
the model and the latter with the attached master-plate blank is
clamped to lathe faceplate. The first hole is then bored to within say
0.002 inch of the finish diameter, to allow for grinding, provided
the master-plate is to be hardened. The central plug is then turned
down to fit the next largest hole and the second hole is bored in the
master-plate. This method is continued until all the holes are bored.
In order to prevent any change in the position of the master-plate
relative to the model, it may be secured by inserting dowel-pins
through both parts, the work being held to the lathe faceplate by
ordinary screw clamps. If the holes in the model do not extend clear
through, a flat plate having parallel sides may be interposed between
the model and master-plate to provide clearance between the two and
prevent cutting into the model when boring the master-plate.</p>

                  Small Equally-spaced Holes in Rows</p>
</div>

<h3>Locating Small Equally-spaced<br /> Holes in Rows</h3>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to drill one or more rows of small
equally-spaced holes. The best method of doing this work naturally
depends, to some extent, upon the accuracy required, but even when a
high degree of accuracy is not necessary, if an attempt is made to lay
out the holes and drill them in the ordinary way, considerable time
is usually required and the results are liable to be unsatisfactory.
For example, suppose a row of holes ¹/₁₆ inch in diameter and ⅛ inch
center-to-center distance were to be drilled in a flat plate. Some
machinists would proceed by first scribing a center-line and then
laying out the centers of the holes by means of dividers. A much easier
and accurate method is <a href="#FIG_18">illustrated in Fig. 18</a>, and is as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Lay out the first hole and drill it; then secure a small piece of flat
steel for a drill guide, drill a hole through it, bevel one corner
and scribe a fine line on the beveled section, as shown in the
illustration. Align the hole drilled in the guide with the hole in the
work, by inserting a close-fitting plug, and clamp a scale against one
edge of the drill guide so that one of the graduation marks exactly
matches with the line on the guide. The edge of the scale must also be
located parallel to the center-line of the row of holes to be drilled.
Now proceed to drill the holes, setting the drill guide each time, to
whatever graduation line represents the required spacing or pitch of
the holes.</p>

<p>It is advisable to use a magnifying glass to accurately align the
graduation mark on the scale with the line on the drill guide. If two
or more rows of holes are to be drilled parallel, the guide block can
be drilled accordingly, so that the different rows of holes can be
finished at the same time. The drill guide block should be relieved
slightly in the center so as to insure the ends of the block bearing
against the edge of the scale. A toolmaker or machinist can drill a row
of holes accurately by this simple method, in the time required to lay
them out in the usual way, and even though accuracy is not necessary,
it is quicker to drill holes by this method than by the one more
commonly employed.</p>

<h3>Use of Disks for Locating<br /> Equally-Spaced Holes</h3>

<p>A simple method of spacing holes that are to be drilled in a
straight line is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>. Two
disks are made, each having a diameter equal to the center-to-center
distance required between the holes. These disks must also have holes
which are exactly central with the outside to act as a guide for the
drill or reamer. The first two holes are drilled in the work while the
disks are clamped so that they are in contact with each other and also
with the straightedge as shown. One disk is then placed on the opposite
side of the other, as indicated by the dotted line, and a third hole
is drilled; this process of setting one disk against the opposite side
of the other is continued until all the holes are drilled. When it is
necessary to drill a parallel row of “staggered” holes, the second row
can be located by placing disks of the proper size in contact with the
first row of disks.</p>

        in a Straight Line<br /> by Means of Disks and Straightedge</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
A method of using disks, which is preferable for very accurate work, is
shown in <a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>. The disks are clamped against
each other and along straightedge <i>A</i> by the screws shown, and if
the outside diameters are correct and the guide holes concentric with
the outside, very accurate work can be done. With this device there
may be as many disks as there are holes to be drilled, if the number
of holes is comparatively small, but if it is necessary to drill a
long row of holes, the disks and frame are shifted along an auxiliary
straightedge <i>B</i>, the hole in one of the end disks being aligned
with the last hole drilled by inserting a close-fitting plug through
the disk and hole.</p>

<h3>Adjustable Jig for Accurate Hole Spacing</h3>

<p>An adjustable jig for accurately spacing small holes is shown in
<a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_20" src="images/i_23.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="299" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 20</b>. Special Disk-jig
                    for Precision Drilling</p>
</div>

<p>This form is especially adapted for locating a number of equally
spaced holes between two previously drilled or bored holes, and the
accuracy of the method lies in the fact that a slight error in the
original spacing of the guide bushing is multiplied, and, therefore,
easily detected. There are two of these guide bushings <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> which are carried by independent slides. These slides can be
shifted along a dovetail groove after loosening the screws of clamp-gib
<i>C</i>. To illustrate the method of using this jig, suppose five
equally-spaced holes are to be located between two holes that are 12
inches apart. As the center-to-center distance between adjacent holes
is 2 inches, slides <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would be set so that the
dimension <i>x</i> equals 2 inches plus the radii of the bushings.
A straightedge is then clamped to the work in such position that a
close-fitting plug can be inserted through the end holes which were
previously drilled or bored. Then with a plug inserted through, say,
bushing <i>B</i> and one of the end holes, the first hole is drilled
and reamed through bushing <i>A</i>; the jig is then shifted to the
left until the plug in <i>B</i> enters the hole just made. The second
hole is then drilled and reamed through bushing <i>A</i> and this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
drilling and shifting of the jig is continued until the last hole is
finished. The distance between the last hole and the original end hole
at the left is next tested by attempting to insert close-fitting plugs
through both bushings. Evidently, if there were any inaccuracy in the
spacing of the bushings, this would be multiplied as many times as the
jig was shifted, the error being accumulative. To illustrate how the
error accumulates, suppose that the bushings were 0.001 inch too far
apart; then the distance to the first hole would be 2.001 inch, to the
second hole, 4.002 inch, and finally the distance from the first to the
sixth hole would be 10.005 inches; consequently, the distance between
the sixth and seventh holes would equal 12-10.005 = 1.995 inch, or
0.005 inch less than the required spacing, assuming, for the sake of
illustration, that the first and last holes were exactly 12 inches
apart. In case of an error of 0.005 inch, the bushings would be set
closer together an amount equal to one-fifth of this error, as near as
could be determined with a micrometer, and all of the holes would then
be re-reamed.</p>

<h3>Methods of Accurately Dividing<br /> a Circle</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to machine a number of holes in a plate so
that all the holes are on a circle or equi-distant from a central
point, and also the same distance apart, within very small limits. A
simple method of spacing holes equally is illustrated at <i>A</i>,
<a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>. A number of buttons equal to the number of holes
required are ground and lapped to exactly the same diameter, preferably by
mounting them all on an arbor and finishing them at the same time. The ends
should also be made square with the cylindrical surface of the button.
When these buttons are finished, the diameter is carefully measured and
this dimension is subtracted from the diameter of the circle on which
the holes are to be located, in order to obtain the diameter <i>d</i>
(see illustration). A narrow shoulder is then turned on the plate to be
bored, the diameter being made exactly equal to dimension <i>d</i>. By
placing the buttons in contact with this shoulder, they are accurately
located radially and can then be set equi-distant from each other by
the use of a micrometer. In this particular case, it would be advisable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
to begin by setting the four buttons which are 90 degrees apart and
then the remaining four. The buttons are next used for setting the work
preparatory to boring. (See “<a href="#BUTTON">Button Method of Accurately
Locating Work</a>.”)</p>

  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 22</b>. Four Methods
                          of Accurately Dividing a Circle</p>
</div>

<h3>Correcting Spacing Errors<br /> by Split Ring Method</h3>

<p>Another method of securing equal spacing for holes in indexing wheels,
etc., is illustrated at <i>B</i>, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>. This method,
however, is not to be recommended if the diameter of the circle on which the
holes are to be located, must be very accurate. The disk or ring in
which the holes are required, is formed of two sections <i>e</i> and
<i>f</i>, instead of being one solid piece. The centers for the holes
are first laid out as accurately as possible on ring <i>e</i>. Parts
<i>e</i> and <i>f</i> are then clamped together and the holes are
drilled through these two sections. Obviously, when the holes are
laid out and drilled in this way, there will be some error in the
spacing, and, consequently, all of the holes would not match, except
when plate <i>e</i> is in the position it occupied when being drilled.
Whatever errors may exist in the spacing can be eliminated, however,
by successively shifting plate <i>e</i> to different positions and
re-reaming the holes for each position. A taper reamer is used and
two pins should be provided having the same taper as the reamer. Ring
<i>e</i> is first located so that a hole is aligned quite accurately
with one in the lower plate. The ring is then clamped and the hole is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
partly reamed, the reamer being inserted far enough to finish the hole
in plate <i>e</i> and also cut clear around in the upper part of plate
<i>f</i>. One of the taper pins is then driven into this hole and then
a hole on the opposite side is partly reamed, after which the other pin
is inserted. The remaining holes are now reamed in the same way, and
the reamer should be fed in to the same depth in each case. If a pair
of holes is considerably out of alignment, it may be necessary to run
the reamer in to a greater depth than was required for the first pair
reamed, and in such a case all the holes should be re-reamed to secure
a uniform size.</p>

<p>The next step in this operation is to remove the taper pins and clamps
or turn index plate <i>e</i> one hole and again clamp it in position.
The reaming process just described is then repeated; the holes on
opposite sides of the plate are re-reamed somewhat deeper, the taper
pins are inserted, and then all of the remaining holes are re-reamed
to secure perfect alignment for the new position of the plate. By
repeating this process of shifting plate <i>e</i> and re-reaming
the holes, whatever error that may have existed originally in the
spacing of the holes, will practically be eliminated. It would be very
difficult, however, to have these holes located with any great degree
of accuracy, on a circle of given diameter.</p>

<h3>Circular Spacing by Contact<br /> of Uniform Disks</h3>

<p>When an accurate indexing or dividing wheel is required on a machine,
the method of securing accurate divisions of the circle illustrated
at <i>C</i>, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>, is sometimes employed. There is a
series of circular disks or bushings equal in number to the divisions required,
and these disks are all in contact with each other and with a circular
boss or shoulder on the plate to which they are attached. The space
between adjacent disks is used to accurately locate the dividing wheel,
engagement being made with a suitable latch or indexing device. When
making a dividing wheel of this kind, all of the disks are ground and
lapped to the same diameter and then the diameter of the central boss
or plate is gradually reduced until all of the disks are in contact
with each other and with the boss. For an example of the practical
application of this method see “<a href="#ORIGIN">Originating a Precision Dividing Wheel</a>.”</p>

<h3>Spacing by Correcting the<br /> Accumulated Error</h3>

<p>Another indexing method of spacing holes equi-distant, is illustrated
by the diagram at <i>D</i>, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>. An accurately fitting
plug is inserted in the central hole of the plate in which holes are required.
Two arms <i>h</i> are closely fitted to this plug but are free to
rotate and are provided with a fine-pitch screw and nut at the outer
ends for adjusting the distance between the arms. Each arm contains an
accurately made, hardened steel bushing <i>k</i> located at the same
radial distance from the center of the plate. These bushings are used
as a guide for the drill and reamer when machining the holes in the plate.</p>

<p>To determine the center-to-center distance between the bushings, divide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
360 by twice the number of holes required; find the sine corresponding
to the angle thus obtained, and multiply it by the diameter of the
circle upon which the holes are located. For example, if there were to
be eleven holes on a circle 8 inches in diameter, the distance between
the centers of the bushings would equal</p>

<table class="fontsize_120 no-wrap" border="0" cellspacing="0" summary=" " cellpadding="0" >
  <tbody><tr>
      <td class="tdc">360</td>
      <td class="tdl" rowspan="2">&nbsp;= 16.36 degrees.</td>
   </tr><tr>
      <td class="tdc over">2 × 11</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="no-indent">The sine of 16.36 degrees is 0.2815, and 0.2815 ×
8 = 2.252 inches. The arms are adjusted to locate the centers of the
bushings this distance apart, by placing closely fitting plugs in the
bushings and measuring from one plug to another with a micrometer or
vernier caliper. Of course, when taking this measurement, allowance is
made for the diameter of the plugs.</p>

<p>After the arms are set, a hole is drilled and reamed; an accurately
fitting plug is then inserted through the bushing and hole to secure
the arms when drilling and reaming the adjacent hole. The radial arms
are then indexed one hole so that the plug can be inserted through one
of the arms and the last hole reamed. The third hole is then drilled
and reamed, and this operation is repeated for all of the holes.
Evidently, if the center-to-center distance between the bushings is
not exactly right, the error will be indicated by the position of the
arms relative to the last hole and the first one reamed; moreover,
this error will be multiplied as many times as there are holes. For
instance, if the arms were too far apart, the difference between
the center-to-center distance of the last pair of holes and the
center-to-center distance of the bushings in the arms, would equal, in
this particular case, eight times the error, and the arms should be
re-adjusted accordingly. Larger bushings would then be inserted in the
arms and the holes re-reamed, this operation being repeated until the
holes were all equi-distant.</p>

<p>As will be seen, the value of this method lies in the fact that it
shows the accumulated error. Thus, if the arms were 0.0005 inch too far
apart, the difference between the first and last hole would equal 8 ×
0.0005 = 0.004 inch. This same principle of dividing can be applied in
various ways. For instance, the radial arms if slightly modified, could
be used for drilling equally-spaced holes in the periphery or disk of a
plate, or, if a suitable marking device were attached, a device of this
kind could be used for accurately dividing circular parts.</p>

<h3 id="ORIGIN">Originating a Precision Dividing Wheel</h3>

<p>There are various methods employed for making accurate indexing wheels
for a definite number of divisions. One of these methods, suitable
particularly for small numbers of divisions, employs a split wheel with
a series of taper holes reamed through the two divisions. By shifting
the two divisions from point to point (as explained in connection with
sketch <i>B</i>, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>) and reaming and re-reaming the
taper holes at each shifting, they may finally be brought very accurately into
position. Another method that has been employed consists in clamping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
about the rim of the dividing wheel a number of precisely similar
blocks, fitting close to each other and to the wheel itself. These
blocks are then used for locating the wheel in each of its several
positions in actual work. A third and simpler method (a modification
of the one last described) consists in grinding a series of disks and
clamping them around a rim of such diameter that the disks all touch
each other and the rim simultaneously, as explained in connection with
sketch <i>C</i>, <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a>. The wheel described in
the following, which is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>,
was made in this way.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_23" src="images/i_28.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="518" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 23</b>. Precision Dividing Wheel</p>
</div>

<p>Disks <i>A</i> are clamped against an accurately ground face of the
wheel <i>B</i> and are supposed to just touch each other all around,
and to be each of them in contact with the ground cylindrical surface
at <i>x</i>. They are held in proper position by bolts <i>C</i> and
nuts <i>D</i>. The bolts fit loosely in the holes of the disks or
bushings <i>A</i> so that the latter are free to be located as may be
desired with reference to the bolts.</p>

<p>One or two improvements in the construction of this type of dividing
wheel may be noted before proceeding to a description of the way in
which it is made. For one thing, instead of having an indexing bolt
enter the V-space between two adjoining disks, a smaller diameter
<i>y</i> is ground on each of them, over which locking finger or pawl
passes, holding the wheel firmly from movement in either direction.
This construction has the advantage of a probable lessening of error by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
locating on each bushing instead of between two bushings; moreover, it
gives a better holding surface and better holding angles than would be
the case if this smaller diameter were not provided.</p>

<p>A second improvement lies in the method of clamping the bushings
<i>A</i> in place. Instead of providing each bolt with a separate
washer, a ring <i>F</i> is used. This ring fits closely on a seat
turned to receive it on the dividing wheel <i>B</i>. When one bushing
<i>A</i> has been clamped in place, the disk is locked from movement so
that there is no possibility, in clamping the remaining bushings, of
having their location disturbed in the slightest degree by the turning
of the nuts in fastening them in place.</p>

<p>The bushings <i>A</i>, of which there were in this case 24, were all
ground exactly to the required diameters on their locating and locking
surfaces. The important things in this operation are, first, that the
large or locating diameter of the bushing should be exactly to size;
and second, that this surface should be in exact alignment with the
diameter in which the locking is done; and, finally, that the face of
the bushing should be squared with the cylindrical surfaces. A refined
exactness for the diameter of the locking surfaces is not so important,
as the form of locking device provided allows slight variations at this
point without impairment of accuracy. This dimension was kept within
very close limits, however. The truth of the two cylindrical surfaces
and the face of the bushing was assured by finishing all these surfaces
in one operation on the grinding machine.</p>

<p>The sizing of the outer diameter of the bushing, which was 1.158 inch,
must be done so accurately that it was not thought wise to trust to
the ordinary micrometer caliper. An indexing device was therefore made
having a calipering lever with a long end, in the ratio of 10 to 1,
which actuated the plunger of a dial test indicator of the well-known
type made by the Waltham Watch Tool Co. The thousandth graduations
on the dial of this indicator would then read in ten-thousandths,
permitting readings to be taken to one-half or one-quarter of this
amount. The final measurements with this device were all taken after
dipping the bushings in water of a certain temperature, long enough to
give assurance that this temperature was universal in all the parts
measured. It will be understood, of course, in this connection, that
getting the diameter of these bushings absolutely to 1.158 inch was
not so important as getting them all exactly alike, whether slightly
over or slightly under this dimension; hence, the precaution taken in
measurement.</p>

<p>Wheel <i>B</i> was next ground down nearly to size, great care being
taken that it should run exactly concentric with the axis. As soon as
the diameter of the surface <i>x</i> was brought nearly to the required
dimension as obtained by calculation, the disks were tried in place.
The first one was put in position with its loose hole central on the
bolt and clamped in place under ring <i>F</i>. The next bushing was
then pressed up against it and against the surface <i>x</i> of the
wheel and clamped in place. The third one was similarly clamped in
contact with its neighboring bushing and the wheel, and so on, until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the whole circle was completed. It was then found that the last disk
would not fill the remaining space. This required the grinding off of
some stock from surface <i>x</i>, and a repetition of the fitting of the
bushings <i>A</i> until they exactly filled the space provided for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_24" src="images/i_30.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="578" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 24</b>. Precision Dividing
                    Wheel and its Indexing Mechanism</p>
</div>

<p>This operation required, of course, considerably more skill than a
simple description of the job would indicate. One of the points that
had to be carefully looked out for was the cleaning of all the surfaces
in contact. A bit of dust or lint on one of the surfaces would throw
the fitting entirely out. The temperature of the parts was another
important consideration. As an evidence of the accuracy with which the
work was done, it might be mentioned that it was found impossible to do
this fitting on a bench on the southern or sunny side of the shop, the
variations of temperature between morning and noon, and between bright
sunshine and passing clouds, being such that the disks would not fit
uniformly. The variation from these minute temperature changes resulted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
from the different coefficients of expansion of the iron wheel and the
steel bushings. The obvious thing to do would be to build a room for
this work kept at a constant temperature and preferably that of the
body, so that the heat of the body would make no difference in the
results. It was found sufficient in this case, however, to do the work
on the northern side of the shop where the temperature was more nearly
constant, not being affected by variations in sunshine.</p>

<p>The dividing wheel, the construction of which has just been described,
was made by the Fellows Gear Shaper Co. It is used for indexing the
Fellows gear cutters in the machine in which the teeth are ground. The
indexing mechanism of this machine is shown in <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>.
It is operated by a handle or lever pinned to rock-shaft <i>H</i>, to
which is keyed arm <i>J</i>. Pivoted to <i>J</i> is a pawl <i>K</i>
engaging the teeth of ratchet <i>L</i>, which revolves loosely on shaft
<i>H</i>. This ratchet <i>L</i> controls the movement of locking finger
<i>E</i>. The parts are shown in their normal or locked position in the
engraving.</p>

<p>As the handle on shaft <i>H</i> is pulled in the direction indicated by
the arrow, arm <i>J</i> is raised, carrying the ratchet wheel around to
the right. This allows flat spring <i>M</i> to drop off of the ratchet
tooth, permitting helical spring <i>O</i> to raise latch <i>E</i> and
thus leave the wheel free. The continued movement of the hand-lever
and of rock-shaft <i>H</i>, by means of gear <i>N</i>, intermediate
pinion <i>P</i> and gear <i>Q</i>, causes the indexing pawl <i>R</i>,
which is pivoted to gear <i>Q</i> and acts on the head of one of the
bolts <i>C</i> (<a href="#FIG_23">see Fig. 23</a>), to index the wheel
one step. Just before reaching its new location the new tooth of
ratchet wheel <i>L</i> coming up, bears down on the top of spring
<i>M</i>, pressing latch <i>E</i> into place against the tension of
coil spring <i>O</i>. By this means the wheel is locked in position.</p>

<p>When the operator pushes the handle on shaft <i>H</i> back again to
its position of rest, the pawl <i>R</i> is retracted into position to
act on the next bolt head for the next indexing. Star-wheel <i>L</i>
remains stationary on this backward movement, being prevented from
revolving by the notch on the top of the tooth into which spring
<i>M</i> fits. Pawl <i>K</i> on its return engages with the next tooth
of this wheel, ready for the next indexing operation.</p>

<p>A slight rotary adjustment of dividing wheel <i>B</i>, independent of
this indexing mechanism, is required for the feeding of the machine.
This is accomplished by the end movement of latch <i>E</i>, which is
pivoted in slide <i>S</i>. This slide is pressed to the right by spring
plunger <i>T</i>, and is adjusted positively in the other direction
by feed-screw <i>U</i>, which is finely graduated to permit accurate
adjustment. The accuracy in indexing obtained by the use of a wheel
thus made was required to bring the finished cutters within the very
narrow limits allowed for them in the final inspection.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">LOCATING WORK FOR BORING<br />
               ON MILLING MACHINE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is often desirable to perform boring operations on the milling
machine, particularly in connection with jig work. Large jigs, which
because of their size or shape could not be conveniently handled in
the lathe, and also a variety of smaller work, can often be bored
to advantage on the milling machine. When such a machine is in good
condition, the necessary adjustments of the work in both vertical and
horizontal planes, can be made with considerable accuracy by the direct
use of the graduated feed-screw dials. It is good practice, however,
when making adjustments in this way, to check the accuracy of the
setting by measuring the center distances between the holes directly.
For the purpose of obtaining fine adjustments when boring on the
milling machine, the Brown &amp; Sharpe Mfg. Co. makes special scales and
verniers that are attached to milling machines, so that the table may
be set by direct measurement. By attaching a scale and vernier to the
table and saddle, respectively, and a second scale to the column with
a vernier on the knee, both longitudinal and vertical measurements can
be made quickly and accurately, and the chance of error resulting from
inaccuracy of the screw, or from lost motion between the screw and nut,
is eliminated.</p>

<h3>Checking Location of Holes by<br /> Micrometer-and-plug Method</h3>

<p>One method of checking the accuracy of the location of holes bored in
the milling machine, is to insert closely fitting ground plugs into the
bored holes and then determine the center-to-center distance by taking
a direct measurement across the plugs with a micrometer or vernier
caliper. For example, if holes were to be bored in a jig-plate, as
shown in <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>, assuming that hole <i>A</i> were finished
first, the platen would then be moved two inches, as shown by the feed dial;
hole <i>B</i> would then be bored slightly under size. Plugs should then be
accurately fitted to these holes, having projecting ends, preferably of
the same size. By measuring from one of these plugs to the other with a
vernier or micrometer caliper, the center distance between them can be
accurately determined, allowance being made, of course, for the radii
of each plug. If this distance is incorrect, the work can be adjusted
before finishing <i>B</i> to size, by using the feed-screw dial. After
hole <i>B</i> is finished, the knee could be dropped 1.5 inch, as shown
by the vertical feed dial, and hole <i>C</i> bored slightly under size;
then by the use of plugs, as before, the location of this hole could be
tested by measuring center distances between <i>C-B</i> and <i>C-A</i>.</p>

<p>An example of work requiring the micrometer-and-plug test, is shown set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
up in the milling machine in <a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>. The large circular
plate shown has a central hole and it was necessary to bore the outer holes in
correct relation with the center hole within a limit of 0.0005 inch.
The center hole was first bored and reamed to size; then an accurately
fitting plug was inserted and the distances to all the other holes
were checked by measuring from this plug. This method of testing with
the plugs is intended to prevent errors which might occur because of
wear in the feed-screws or nuts, that would cause the graduated dials
to give an incorrect reading. On some jig work, sufficient accuracy
could be obtained by using the feed-screw dials alone, that is, without
testing with the plugs, in which case the accuracy would naturally
depend largely on the condition of the machine.</p>

                     Boring on Milling Machine</p>
</div>

<p>A method that is a modification of the one in which plugs are used
to test the center distance is as follows: All the holes are first
drilled with suitable allowance for boring, the location being obtained
directly by the feed-screw dials. A special boring-tool, the end of
which is ground true with the shank, is then inserted in the spindle
and the first hole, as at <i>A</i> in <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a> is finished,
after which the platen is adjusted for hole <i>B</i> by using the dial as before.
A close-fitting plug is then inserted in hole <i>A</i> and the accuracy
of the setting is obtained by measuring the distance between this plug
and the end of the boring-tool, which is a combination tool and test
plug. In a similar manner, the tool is moved from one position to
another, and, as all the holes have been previously drilled, all are
bored without removing the tool from the spindle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Another modification of the micrometer-and-plug method is illustrated
in Figs. <a href="#FIG_26">26</a> and <a href="#FIG_27">27</a>.
It is assumed that the plate to be bored is finished on the edges, and
that it is fastened to an angle-plate, which is secured to the table
of the milling machine and set square with the spindle. A piece of
cold-rolled steel or brass is first fastened in the chuck (which is
mounted on the spindle) and turned off to any diameter. This diameter
should preferably be an even number of thousandths, to make the
calculations which are to follow easier. The turning can be done either
by holding the tool in the milling machine vise, or by securing it to
the table with clamps. In either case, the tool should be located near
the end of the table, so as to be out of the way when not in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_26" src="images/i_34.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="415" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 26</b>. Obtaining Vertical
         Adjustment by Means of<br /> Depth Gage and turned Plug in Chuck</p>
</div>

<p>After the piece in the chuck is trued, the table and knee are adjusted
until the center of the spindle is in alignment with the center of the
first hole to be machined. This setting of the jig-plate is effected
by measuring with a micrometer depth gage from the top and sides of
the work, to the turned plug, as illustrated in <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>.
When taking these measurements, the radius of the plug in the chuck is, of course,
deducted. When the plate is set the plug is removed from the chuck and
the first hole drilled and bored or reamed to its proper size. We shall
assume that the holes are to be located as shown by the detail view,
<a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>, and that hole <i>A</i> is the first one bored.
The plug is then again inserted in the chuck and trued with the tool, after which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
it is set opposite the place where the second hole <i>B</i> is to be
bored; this is done by inserting an accurately fitting plug in hole
<i>A</i> and measuring from this plug to the turned piece in the chuck,
with an outside micrometer as indicated in <a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>.
Allowance is, of course, again made for the radii of the two plugs. The
horizontal measurement can be taken from the side of the work with a
depth gage as before. The plug is then removed and the hole drilled and
bored to the proper size. The plug is again inserted in the chuck and
turned true; the table is then moved vertically to a position midway
between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and then horizontally to the proper
position for hole <i>C</i>, as indicated by the depth gage from the
side of the work. The location can be verified by measuring the center
distances <i>x</i> with the micrometer. In a similar manner holes
<i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, <i>F</i> and <i>G</i> are accurately located.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_27" src="images/i_35.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="438" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 27</b>. Adjusting for
     Center-to-center Distance<br /> by use of Plugs and Micrometer</p>
</div>

<p>If the proper allowances are made for the variation in the size of the
plug, which, of course, is made smaller each time it is trued, and if
no mistakes are made in the calculations, this method is very accurate.
Care should be taken to have the gibs on all sides fairly tight at the
beginning, and these should not be tightened after each consecutive
alignment, as this generally throws the work out a few thousandths. If
the reductions in the size of the plug, each time it is turned, are
confusing, new plugs can be used each time a test is made, or the end
of the original plug can be cut off so that it can be turned to the
same diameter for every test. If the center distances <i>x</i> are not
given, it is, of course, far more convenient to make all the geometric
calculations before starting to work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<h3>The Button-and-plug Method</h3>

<p>The use of the button method as applied to the milling machine, is
illustrated in <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>, where a plain jig-plate
is shown set up for boring. The jig, with buttons <i>B</i> accurately
located in positions corresponding to the holes to be bored, is clamped
to the angle-plate <i>A</i> that is set at right angles to the spindle.
Inserted in the spindle there is a plug <i>P</i>, the end of which is
ground to the exact size of the indicating buttons. A sliding sleeve
<i>S</i> is accurately fitted to this plug and when the work is to be
set for boring a hole, the table and knee of the machine are adjusted
until the sleeve <i>S</i> will pass over the button representing
the location of the hole, which brings the button and spindle into
alignment. When setting the button in alignment, all lost motion or
backlash should be taken up in the feed-screws. For instance, if the
button on the jig should be a little higher than the plug in the
spindle, do not lower the knee until the bushing slips over the button,
but lower the knee more than is required and then raise it until the
bushing will pass over the button. This same rule should be followed
for longitudinal adjustments.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_28" src="images/i_36.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="443" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 28</b>. Accurate Method
              of Aligning Spindle with Button on Jig-Plate</p>
</div>

<p>After the button is set by this method, it is removed and the plug in
the spindle is replaced by a drill and then by a boring-tool or reamer
for finishing the hole to size. In a similar manner the work is set
for the remaining holes. The plug <i>P</i> for the spindle must be
accurately made so that the outer end is concentric with the shank,
and the latter should always be inserted in the spindle in the same
relative position. With a reasonable degree of care, work can be set
with considerable precision by this method, providing, of course, the
buttons are properly set.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>Some toolmakers use, instead of the plug and sleeve referred to, a test
indicator for setting the buttons concentric with the machine spindle.
This indicator is attached to and revolves with the spindle, while the
point is brought into contact with the button to be set. The difficulty
of seeing the pointer as it turns is a disadvantage, but with care
accurate results can be obtained.</p>

<h3>Size Block and Gage Method</h3>

<p>Another method which can at times be employed for accurately
locating a jig-plate in different positions on an angle-plate, is shown
in <a href="#FIG_29">Fig. 29</a>. The angle-plate is, of course, set at
right angles to the spindle and depth gages and size blocks are used
for measuring directly the amount of adjustment. Both the angle-plate
and work should have finished surfaces on two sides at right angles
to each other, from which measurements can be taken. After the first
hole has been bored, the plate is adjusted the required distance both
horizontally and vertically, by using micrometer depth gages, which
should preferably be clamped to the angle-plate. If the capacity of the
gages is exceeded, measurements may be taken by using standard size
blocks in conjunction with the depth gages.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_29" src="images/i_37.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="345" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 29</b>. Locating Work from
      Edges of Angle-Plate<br /> by means of Depth Gages and Size Blocks</p>
</div>

<p>It is frequently necessary to bore holes in cast jig-plates or machine
parts, which either have irregularly shaped or unfinished edges. A good
method of locating such work is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>.
The part to be bored is attached to an auxiliary plate <i>A</i> which should
have parallel sides and at least two edges which are straight and at right
angles to each other. This auxiliary plate with the work, is clamped
against an accurate angle-plate <i>B</i>, which should be set square
with the axis of the machine spindle. A parallel strip is bolted to the
angle-plate and the inner edge is set square with the machine table.
After the first hole is bored, the work is located for boring the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
to the edge of the auxiliary plate, and horizontal measurements
<i>y</i> between the parallel and the plate. These measurements,
if quite large, might be taken with micrometer gages, whereas, for
comparatively small adjustments, size blocks might be more convenient.</p>

<h3>Vernier Height Gage and Plug Method</h3>

<p>When a vernier height gage is available, it can often be used to
advantage for setting work preparatory to boring in a milling machine.
One advantage of this method is that it requires little in the way of
special equipment. The work is mounted on an angle-plate or directly
on the platen, depending on its form, and at one end an angle-plate is
set up with its face parallel to the spindle. An accurately finished
plug is inserted in the spindle and this plug is set vertically from
the platen and horizontally from the end angle-plate, by measuring with
the vernier height gage. After the plug is set for each hole, it is, of
course, removed and the hole drilled and bored or reamed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_30" src="images/i_38.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 30</b>. Method of Holding and
          Locating Casting<br /> of Irregular Shape, for Boring Holes</p>
</div>

<p>The way the plug and height gage is used is clearly illustrated in
Figs. <a href="#FIG_31">31</a> and <a href="#FIG_32">32</a>.
The work, in this particular case, is a small jig. This is clamped
directly to the machine table and at one end an angle-plate is also
bolted to the table. This angle-plate is first set parallel with
the traverse of the saddle or in line with the machine spindle. To
secure this alignment, an arbor is inserted in the spindle and a test
indicator is clamped to it by gripping the indicator between bushings
placed on the arbor. The table is then moved longitudinally until the
contact point of the indicator is against the surface plate; then by
traversing the saddle crosswise, any lack of parallelism between the
surface of the angle-plate and the line of saddle traverse will be
shown by the indicator.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
When the work is to be adjusted horizontally, the vernier height gage
is used as shown in <a href="#FIG_32">Fig. 32</a>, the base of the gage resting
on the angle-plate and the measurement being taken to an accurately ground and
lapped plug in the spindle. For vertical adjustments, the measurements
are taken between this ground plug and the machine platen as in <a href="#FIG_31">Fig. 31</a>.</p>

<h3>Locating Holes to be Bored<br /> from Center-punch Marks</h3>

<p>The problem of accurately locating holes to be bored on the milling
machine has received much attention, and the method generally used when
accuracy has been required is the button method, which was previously
described. So much time is required for doing the work by this method,
however, that numerous efforts have been made to obtain equally good
results in other ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_33" src="images/i_40.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="375" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 33</b>. Diagram Illustrating Rapid
     but Accurate Method of<br /> Locating Holes to be bored on Milling Machine</p>
</div>

<p>The increasing demand for rapidity combined with accuracy and a minimum
liability of error, led to the development of the system described in
the following: A center-punch mark takes the place of the button, from
which to indicate the work into the proper position for boring. The
fundamental principle involved is to lay out, accurately, two lines
at right angles to each other, and correctly center-punch the point
where they intersect. With proper care, lines may be drawn with a
vernier height gage at right angles, with extreme accuracy, the chief
difficulty being to accurately center the lines where they cross. For
semi-accurate work this may be done with a common center-punch but
where extreme accuracy is required this method is not applicable, as
the average man is incapable of marking the point of intersection
accurately.</p>

<p>The diagram, <a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>, illustrates, in a simple way, the
procedure adopted in laying out work by this system. The base <i>E</i> is in
contact with a surface plate while the line <i>BB</i> is drawn with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
height gage; then with side <i>F</i> on the plate the line <i>AA</i> is
drawn. It will be seen that these lines will be at right angles to each
other, if the bases <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are square. Work done by this
method must have two working surfaces or base lines, and these must
be at right angles to each other. There is no difficulty in drawing
the locating lines <i>AA</i> and <i>BB</i> correctly, either with a
vernier height gage or with a special micrometer gage reading to 0.0001
inch, the only difficult element being to accurately center-punch the
lines where they intersect as at <i>D</i>. It is assumed that two holes
are to be bored, so that the intersection at <i>C</i> would also be
center-punched.</p>

<p>The scriber point of the height gage should be ground so that it
will make a V-shaped line, as shown by the enlarged sketch <i>G</i>,
rather than one which would resemble a saw-tooth, as at <i>H</i>, if a
cross-section of it were examined with a microscope. This is important
because when the lines are V-shaped, an accurate point of intersection
is obtained.</p>

   <p class="center"><b>Fig. 35</b>. Center Enlarging Punch</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>As it is quite or almost impossible to accurately center-punch the
intersection of even two correctly drawn lines, by ordinary means, the
punch shown in Figs. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a> and <a href="#FIG_36">36</a>
was designed and an extended experience with it on a very high grade
of work has demonstrated its value for the purpose. It consists
essentially of a small center-punch <i>O</i> (<a href="#FIG_36">Fig.
36</a>) held in vertical position by a holder <i>P</i> which is knurled
to facilitate handling. Great care should be exercised in making this
tool to have the body of the punch straight, and to have it stand at
right angles to the surface to be operated upon, for the slightest
inclination will cause the finished hole to be incorrect, no matter how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
carefully the lines are drawn. The 60-degree point must be ground true
with the axis. The holder for the punch stands on three legs, located
as indicated, and ground accurately to a taper fit in the holder, where
they are secured by watch screws bearing on their tops. The lower ends
are hardened, and terminate in an angular point of 55 degrees (the
point of the vernier scriber being 60 degrees). The edges are sharp,
and slightly rounded at the ends, so that the legs will slide along
a line smoothly. The points <i>V</i> and <i>U</i> (<a href="#FIG_36">Fig. 36</a>)
have edges that are in line with each other, while the point <i>T</i> has an edge
at right angles to the other two. The center of the punch is located at
equal distances from all the legs, and is held off the work normally by
a leather friction acted upon by a set-screw in the side of holder <i>P</i>.</p>

<div class="figcontainer">
  <div class="figsub">
   <img id="FIG_36" src="images/i_42a.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="455" />

   <p class="center"><b>Fig. 37</b>. Section of<br /> Center Enlarging Punch</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>If this tool is placed upon lines of the form shown at <i>G</i>, <a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>,
the legs <i>V</i> and <i>U</i> may be slid along horizontal line
<i>B-B</i>, <a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>, until the sharp edge of leg <i>T</i>
drops into line <i>A-A</i>. When this occurs the punch <i>O</i> is lightly tapped
with a hammer, and the resulting mark will be accurately located in the
center of the intersection of the lines. It is good practice to make
the work very smooth before drawing the lines, and after laying them
out, to stone them so as to remove the slight burr raised in drawing
them. A drop of oil is then rubbed into the lines, and the surplus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
wiped off. This procedure permits points <i>V</i> and <i>U</i> to run
very smoothly along the line, and the burr having been removed, the
edge of leg <i>T</i> drops into the line very readily with a slight
click. As it is not advisable to strike punch <i>O</i> more than a
very light blow, it marks the work but slightly, and a more distinct
indentation is made with the follower punch shown in Figs.
<a href="#FIG_35">35</a> and <a href="#FIG_37">37</a>.
This punch is made like the previous one, so that it will stand at
right angles to the work. The sectional view (<a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>) shows
the punch <i>A</i> supported by the holder <i>E</i> which has four legs cut away
on the sides so that the point of the punch may be seen. When this
punch is in position, it is struck a sufficiently heavy blow to make a
distinctly visible mark. The work is now ready to be placed upon the
work table of the milling machine, and indicated for boring the holes,
an indicator being used in the milling machine spindle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_38" src="images/i_43.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="393" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 38</b>. Indicator used for
                        Aligning Punch Marks with Machine Spindle</p>
</div>

<p>An indicator which has been found especially valuable for this purpose
is shown in Figs. <a href="#FIG_38">38</a> and <a href="#FIG_39">39</a>.
It is of the concentric centering type, and with it the work is
brought concentric with the axis of the spindle. The arbor <i>I</i>
is provided with a threaded nose on which disk <i>D</i> is screwed.
This disk has four holes in its rim, equally-spaced from each other.
Hardened, ground, and lapped bushings <i>b</i> are put into these
holes to receive plug <i>A</i> which is made a gage-fit both in these
holes and in hole <i>B</i> in the outer end of sector <i>C</i>. This
sector is held by a split sleeve to the barrel <i>L</i> which carries
the 60-degree centering-rod <i>K</i> that comes into contact with the
work to be bored. The spherical base of barrel <i>L</i> fits into a
corresponding concave seat in the nose of the arbor at <i>H</i>, and
is held in place by a spring <i>E</i> which connects at one end to the
cylindrical stud in the base of the barrel, and at the other to the
axial rod <i>M</i> by which it and the other connecting parts may be
drawn into place, and held by the headless set-screw <i>J</i>, bearing
on a flat spot on the tang end of the rod.</p>

<p>Now, if plug <i>A</i> is removed from bushing <i>b</i> the point of the
centering-rod <i>K</i> may be made to describe a circle. At some point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
within this circle is located the center-punch mark on the work to be
bored. The holes in the rim of the faceplate all being exactly the
same distance from an axial line through both the arbor <i>I</i> and
centering-rod <i>K</i>, it follows that the center mark on the work
must be so located by horizontal and vertical movements of the work
table that pin <i>A</i> may be freely entered in all the four holes in
the rim of disk <i>D</i>. When that occurs, the center coincides with
the axis of the spindle.</p>

<p>The point of the center-punch <i>A</i> (<a href="#FIG_37">Fig. 37</a>) should
have an angle slightly greater than the angle on the centering-rod <i>K</i>, as it
is impossible to locate the work in the preliminary trials so that the
center of the work will be coincident with the axis of the spindle, and
unless the precaution mentioned is taken, the true center on the work
is liable to be drawn from its proper location when trying to bring the
work into such a position that the plug will enter all the holes in the
disk. As the work being operated on is brought nearer to the proper
location by the movements of the milling machine table, spring <i>G</i>
will be compressed, the center rod sliding back into barrel <i>L</i>.
This spring is made so that it will hold the center against the work
firmly, but without interfering with the free rotation of the sector
<i>C</i> around disk <i>D</i>. When the work is located so that the
plug enters the holes, the gibs of the machine should be tightened up
and the plug tried once more, to make sure that the knee of the machine
has not moved sufficiently to cause the work on the table to be out of
line. The work table is now clamped to prevent accidental horizontal
shifting, and the work is drilled and bored.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img id="FIG_39" src="images/i_44.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="407" />
  <p class="center space-below2"><b>Fig. 39</b>. Sectional View of
                   Indicator shown in Fig. 38</p>
</div>

<p>In using this indicator the milling machine spindle is not rotated
together with arbor <i>I</i>, only the sector being turned around the
disk. The tool is set, however, in the beginning, so that the axes of
two of the bushings <i>b</i> are at right angles to the horizontal
plane of the machine table, while the axes of the other holes in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
disk are parallel with the top of the work table. The centering-rods
are made interchangeable and of various lengths, to reach more or less
accessible centers. <a href="#FIG_38">Fig. 38</a> shows the indicator
with one of the long center-rods in the foreground.</p>

<p>The only part of the milling machine on which dependence must be placed
for accuracy is the hole in the spindle, and this is less liable to get
out of truth, from wear such as would impair the accuracy, than are the
knee, table, or micrometer screws. The only moving part is the sector,
and this, being light, is very sensitive.</p>

<p>A series of 24 holes was laid out and bored in one and one-half day by
the method described in the foregoing. Measurements across accurately
lapped plugs in the holes, showed the greatest deviation from truth
to be 0.0002 inch, and running from that to accuracy so great that no
error was measurable. This same work with buttons would have required
considerably more time.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
